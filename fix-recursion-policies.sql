-- Fix infinite recursion in group_members policies

-- Drop the problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view members of groups they belong to" ON group_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Group owners can manage members" ON group_members;

-- Create non-recursive policies for group_members
-- Allow users to view their own membership records
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own memberships" ON group_members

-- Allow users to view other members of groups where they are also members
-- This uses a simpler approach without recursion
